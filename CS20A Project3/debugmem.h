/*
Basic dynamic memory tracer: works by replacing new/delete, new[]/delete[] with
		overloaded versions that track the addresses of the allocated memory.

Usage:	All three files: debugmem.h, memorymanager.cpp/.h must be present in project.
		Include debugmem.h in all files that calls new and delete, do not
		explicity include memorymanager.h.  memorymanager.cpp/.h only need to be present
		in the project, you do not need to do anything or call any function within them.
		Everything is handled with the inclusion of debugmem.h.

		Replace all calls to 'new' you want to track with DEBUG_NEW

		To get a report of the current allocations call GETMEMORYREPORT().
